## Setting up a simple webpage on EC2 with a custom URL using Terraform

In a previous [blog](webpage-custom-url.md), we created a basic static site on EC2 using mainly AWS CLI commands.  In this blog we will see how we can automate much of this process using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).  The final code for this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/imrankhan17/terraform-aws).
